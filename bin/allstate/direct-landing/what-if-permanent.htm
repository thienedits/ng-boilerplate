                        	<h2>What If I Need Something More Permanent?</h2>
                            <p class="box">Permanent life insurance is designed to last your lifetime.  With each payment you make to a permanent life insurance policy, part of your premium payment goes toward insuring your life, and part goes toward building cash value. These premiums are typically higher than term life insurance premiums, because you are also accumulating cash value in your policy in addition to death benefit protection. Like owning a home, permanent insurance builds cash value that you can borrow against or withdraw.<sup>1</sup></p>
