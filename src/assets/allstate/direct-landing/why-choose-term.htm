                            <p class="box-full" >Term life insurance is relatively inexpensive, and it covers a set amount of time—usually 10, 15, 20, or 30 years. You choose the duration and the coverage amount for your policy. Because of its affordability, a term life policy can be a great choice for young families, stay-at-home parents, or even people who already have a life insurance policy that they want to supplement.</p>
                            <p class="box-full">Think of term life insurance like renting a home or leasing a car. You choose the length of time (the term) and amount of coverage, and your payments stay the same until the end of your term regardless of any changes to your health. If you pass away during that time period, your beneficiaries receive a cash death benefit that is generally paid out tax free. If you realize you want coverage that extends beyond your current term or if your coverage needs change over time, you typically have the option to convert a term policy into a permanent policy within certain time limitations.</p>
