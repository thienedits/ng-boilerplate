                        	<h2>How Much Term Coverage Do I Need?</h2>
                            <p class="box">The coverage amount you need depends on various aspects of your life and what is most important to you. Life insurance benefits can help your loved ones if you are no longer here to help with expenses such as housing costs, tuition fees, or medical expenses. A good rule of thumb is that 7-10 times your annual salary will provide adequate income security. Weâ€™ve also provided a tool that can help you calculate and determine what your insurance needs might be. Simply <a href="../quote/default.aspx">start a quote</a> and enter the appropriate information to find out how much coverage may be right for you. If you already know how much coverage you need or if you have a monthly cost in mind that you can comfortably afford, you can adjust the coverage accordingly.</p>
